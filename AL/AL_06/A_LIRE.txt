Hello Marcer,

Another release for AL !

I optimize this version with Jedi 
muzaxx, I sorry about that ! :-(
But I noticed that I've the same pbl 
with another intros and effects !!!

I'm waiting the "feu vert" from Mister A 
for his last version of the gfx, I think 
that's a good idea to wait for ?

About AL_11.prg, another - maybe - release 
for AL, Marteau give me the source and I 
see with him to use for AL intro ? I manage 
a lot of changing and finality, Atomus talk 
to me about STF conversion, the asm routs 
need some big modifications. I admit that 
my overscan need some "regulations" ;)
This intro works only on Steem...

A++
