Hi!

Thanks for your EMail!  The Intros functions perfectly.  Good work!!!

I arranged and send the DCD 135 to you for completion the Intro inclusive the 
Scroller.
You can still extend this and register naturally own greetings with. 
Continues to occur to me there for the moment nothing...

Hopefully can place the old 3D Intro to it still completely. It looked really 
very good.

OK, i the second Intro into the DCD 136 will build and sends you the data as 
soon as i is finished.

Best greetings....
