Hihooooooo Fred!

I fight with your SOURCE code.  O.o
With which assembler do I have to work? I tried turbo-assembler and DevPac 2.0 / 3.10.....
Unfortunately without success.
Turbo-assembler cannot read the sourcecode in error free and Devpac produces an incorrect menu when assembling :-(

Please assemble for me the menu with the complete Scrolltext. I send you in addition the original email again.

I have now begun write a database, in which all relevant demo Compils with contents are seized. Hard work for several months.....

Thanks again :-D
